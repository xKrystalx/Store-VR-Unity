# Store-VR-Unity

The app is a Virtual Reality store application that integrates with a traditional online store. In a nutshell, it allows users to search, preview the products in their real world scale and in 3D, interact with some of them and finally make orders.

The goal of this application is to assess the potential of such idea as the next step in online shopping evolution.

If you have a VR headset and wish to try out the application (greatly appreciated), follow the link below:
